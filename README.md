# Techaciam Website Project

## Project Overview

This project involves creating a multi-page website for Techaciam, a startup company providing innovative IT solutions and problem-solving services. The website consists of the following sections:

- Homepage
- About Us
- Services
- Careers
- Contact Us

Each section is designed to be visually appealing, user-friendly, and consistent in terms of design and layout.


## Approach

# 1. HTML Structure

Each page (index.html, about.html, services.html, careers.html, contact.html) follows a similar structure:

- Header: Contains the company logo and navigation menu, consistent across all pages.
- Main Content: Varies for each page based on its purpose and content requirements.
- Footer: Contains social media links and copyright information, consistent across all pages.

# 2. CSS Styling

The styling is organized to maintain consistency and enhance the user experience:

- home.css: Common styles used across all pages, including header and footer styles, and responsive design adjustments.
- about.css: Specific styles for the About Us page, making it visually appealing with appropriate spacing and alignment.
- services.css: Specific styles for the Services page, ensuring each service is displayed in a visually appealing box with icons/images and descriptions.
- careers.css: Specific styles for the Careers page, detailing open positions and internships with a call-to-action button.
- contact.css: Specific styles for the Contact Us page, displaying contact information in a clear and accessible manner.

# 3. Responsive Design

The website is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices and screen sizes. Media queries are used in the common CSS file (home.css) to adjust the layout and styling for smaller screens.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- HTML5: For structuring the web pages.
- CSS3: For styling the web pages.
- Visual Studio Code: As the code editor for developing the project.
- Web Browsers: For testing and debugging the web pages (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox).

## How to View the Project

To view the project locally:

1. Download or clone the project repository.
2. Open the `home.html` file in a web browser to view the homepage.
3. Use the navigation menu to explore the About Us, Services, Careers, and Contact Us pages.

## Future Enhancements

- Add more detailed content and images to each section.
- Implement additional features such as a contact form on the Contact Us page.
- Enhance the styling and animations for a more dynamic user experience.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the creation of a multi-page website with consistent design and responsive layout. It provides a solid foundation for further development and customization based on specific requirements.
